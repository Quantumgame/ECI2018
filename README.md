## Lab 1 ##

To run Lab 1, navigate to Lab1/EncodingModels.ipynb and launch the notebook.

## Notes on running on binder ##
For some computations, binder's available compute power is limited, so we have reduced the size of the dataset and models we fit.

To run on your own machine, simply run:

`git clone https://www.github.com/libertyh/ECI2018`

You will need [Anaconda python](https://www.anaconda.com/downloads), including jupyter notebook.  I recommend v3.6.  This code may work in python v2 but has not been extensively tested.
